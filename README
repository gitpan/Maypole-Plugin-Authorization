Maypole-Plugin-Authorization version 0.05
=========================================

Maypole::Plugin::Authorization provides simple role-based authorization
for Maypole applications. It uses the database to store permissions,
which fits well with Maypole.

It determines whether users are authorized to invoke specific methods in
classes. Normally these methods will be actions in model classes.
Permission to invoke methods is not granted directly; it is assigned to
roles, and each user may be assigned one or more roles.

See the POD in the module for further details.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

Maypole, version 2.09 or later.

It also relies on some other module to authenticate the user, but we're
not too picky about it. See the POD and the test files for ideas. It
should run with Maypole::Plugin::Authentication::UserSessionCookie or
Maypole::Plugin::Authentication::Abstract, for example.
